# VegOut Pie Calculator

This is a simple C++ console application that calculates the total amount spent by a customer at 
"VegOut" based on the number of cheese and potato pies purchased. 
It also checks if the total spent is within a hardcoded budget of $100.

## How it Works

The program prompts the user to answer if they bought cheese pies and/or potato pies. 
If "yes," it asks for the quantity of each. 
It then calculates the total cost based on the following prices:

* **Cheese Pie:** $22.50 each
* **Potato Pie:** $16.50 each

Finally, it displays the total amount spent and indicates whether the customer is 
"Within Budget" (total spent <= $100) or "Over Budget."

## Example Usage

Let's say a customer bought 2 potato pies and 3 cheese pies: 
Did you purchase a cheese pie? yes
How many did you buy? 3
Did you purchase a potatoe pie? yes
How many did you buy? 2
Your total is: %100.5
You Are Over Budget :(
